# Spacetime Keyboard

The Spacetime is a ~36% split ortho-linear keyboard based on
the Half n Half, ErgoDox and Helix. It has a tripple thumb cluster
and an optional palm key. The palm key can be broken off and not
used at all if you don't want it.

Currently being shipped some prototypes and I will probably have
some bugs to work out. After that I will need to add more silk screen
and I need to create jumper pads to support the OLED that can go over
the microcontroller.
